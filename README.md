- 👋 Good morning! I’m Aria Diamond (she/they).
- 👀 I’m interested in privacy and full stack design/development, although I am open to most
     coding related jobs!
- 🖥 I have the most experience with backend design, such as HTTP servers, including REST and
     distributed systems. Examples of backends I've worked on are Nan an HTTPS server for displaying
     dynamic web pages, and Cryptik, a REST server that manages data transfer between clients.
- ❗️ A PDF version of my resume is available [here](Resume.pdf), and contains similar information to
     this README, with the inclusion of work experience and skills (at the cost of a shorter
     projects section).

## Projects
- 🐐 [Nan, an HTTP Server](https://github.com/ariadiamond/Nan-http). Includes config files to build
     web pages from markdown and HTML files. Written in Golang with functional tests in python3.
- 📊 [Data visualizations](https://observablehq.com/@ariadiamond/wildfires-interdependence-of-humans-and-nature)
     of wildfires in California. Uses D3.js to build various types of visualizations (including
     common ones like line charts and choropleth maps) with some interactivity.
- 📝 [CS-GY 6903 Notes](https://github.com/ariadiamond/cs6903_project2/tree/AriaNote/AriaNote). This
     contains the notes written for Applied Cryptography at NYU. The notes were originally written
     in markdown, then transpiled to HTML using pandoc (done by the HTTP server above). This makes
     extensive use LaTeX (rendered using MathJax) for mathmatical equations. There are additionally
     JavaScript applets to show concrete examples of theory used in class.
- 🔏 [Cryptik](https://github.com/ariadiamond/cs6903_project2). A secure messaging platform that
     provides end-to-end encryption using a client server model. The backend is written in Golang,
     with connection to a PostgreSQL server and dockerfiles to allow containerization of the
     backend. Data is encrypted with AES-256 GCM and verified with ed25519 signatures. The frontend
     is HTML and CSS for webpage visualization, and JavaScript for functionality.
- 💿 [Twizzler Documentation](https://github.com/ariadiamond/twizzler/tree/api-update).
     Documentation for userspace functions in the Twizzler operating system. Twizzler is a research
     operating system that uses byte-addressable non-volatile memory to remove many layers of
     indirection present in many operating systems to support access to old persistent storage
     mediums (such as disk). The documentation is written in Doxygen.

## Education
- 👩‍🎓 Graduated Magna Cum Laude and highest honors in the major for computer science BS at UCSC, June
     2021.
- 💜 Attended NYU Tandon School of Engineering for their Cybersecurity MS. Dropped out after Fall
     semester because the degree felt too practical and like skills I could easily learn in
     industry.
