- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ariadiamond
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in privacy and full stack design/development
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently a student at NYU Tandon in the Cyber Security MS program.

## Projects
- [HTTP Server](https://github.com/ariadiamond/Wi21-Server). Includes config files to build webpages from markdown and HTML files.
  Written in Golang with functional tests in python3.
- [Data visualizations](https://observablehq.com/@ariadiamond/wildfires-interdependence-of-humans-and-nature) of wildfires in California.
  Uses D3.js to build various types of visualizations (including common ones like line charts and choropleth maps) with some interactivity.
- [CS-GY 6903 Project 1](https://github.com/ariadiamond/cs6813_project1). This was a project to break a shift cipher with multi-character keys,
  random key scheduling, and random bytes inserted, in the context of a known plaintext attack.
  The cryptanalysis program is written in python3, but test scripts and helper programs are written in sh and C and can be found in the `test`
  directory. `test/testAll.sh` is the most up to date fully developed script. This repository will be made private at the end of the year.
- [CS-GY 6903 Notes](https://github.com/ariadiamond/cs6813_project1/tree/ariaNote/AriaNote). This contains the notes written for Applied Cryptography
  at NYU. The notes were originally written in markdown, then transpiled to HTML using pandoc (done by the HTTP server above). This makes extensive use 
  LaTeX (rendered using MathJax) for mathmatical equations. There are additionally JavaScript applets to show concrete examples of theory used in class.
  This repository will be made private at the end of the year.
