- 👋 Good morning! I’m Aria Diamond.
- 👀 I’m most interested in front-end development, but I'm open to working with any part of the
     stack.
- 🖥 Currently working as a full stack engineer working primarily on web frontend with technologies
     like React and Sass.
- ❗️ A PDF version of my resume is available [here](Resume.pdf), and contains similar information to
     this README.

## Work experience
- 🎧 [ListenFirst Media](listenfirstmedia.com) - Full Stack Software Engineer - March 2022 - Present
    - Developed new features according to product standards.
    - Investigated and fixed bugs in both front-end and back-end.
    - **Continuous integration:** restored outdated tests to a working state, and ran automated pull
      request builds on a Jenkins server.
    - **Batch Upload Tags:** allowed users to upload tags and their associated posts, which were then
      queryable in the platform.
    - **Code clean up:** Deleted tens of thousands of lines of dead code. This decreased the size of
      code bundles by over a megabyte, improving performance for clients.
    - **Reactify Legacy Application:** Currently migrating a single page application from
      Backbone.js and jQuery to React, including unifying state in a single store with pure
      rerenders, and improving readability of event handling to increase maintainability for future
      tweaks.

## Projects
- 🔏 [Journal](https://github.com/ariadiamond/Journal). A Journaling app that feels like texting a
     close friend. Written in ReactNative with TypeScript.
- 🐐 [Nan, an HTTP Server](https://github.com/ariadiamond/Nan-http). Includes config files to build
     web pages from markdown and HTML files. Written in Golang with functional tests in python3.
- 📊 [Data visualizations](https://observablehq.com/@ariadiamond/wildfires-interdependence-of-humans-and-nature)
     of wildfires in California. Uses D3.js to build various types of visualizations (including
     common ones like line charts and choropleth maps) with some interactivity.
- 🔏 [Cryptik](https://github.com/ariadiamond/cs6903_project2). A secure messaging platform that
     provides end-to-end encryption using a client server model. The backend is written in Golang,
     with connection to a PostgreSQL server and dockerfiles to allow containerization of the
     backend. Data is encrypted with AES-256 GCM and verified with ed25519 signatures. The frontend
     is HTML and CSS for webpage visualization, and JavaScript for functionality.

## Education
- 👩‍🎓 Graduated Magna Cum Laude and highest honors in the major for computer science BS at UCSC, June
     2021.
- 💜 Attended NYU Tandon School of Engineering for their Cybersecurity MS. Dropped out after Fall
     semester because the degree felt too practical and like skills I could easily learn in
     industry.
